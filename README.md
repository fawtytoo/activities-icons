# Activities Icons

## Description
A Gnome Shell extension that replaces the Activities button with 2 icons for selecting between Applications and Workspaces.

The Activities button becomes 2 icons for selecting either Applications or Workspaces in the overview. Selecting the same view again will hide the overview.

Scrolling on the icons allows switching windows on a workspace or cycling through the Workspaces.
